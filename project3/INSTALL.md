# How to run

To compile and run, you just need to launch the `compile_and_run.sh` file. To use it, you need to call it with three arguments:
`compile_and_run.sh <file_path> <delta_time> <max_steps>` where `file_path` is the input file containing the initial state of the molecule, `delta_time` is the time step used for the Verlet Algorithm and `max_steps` is the maximum number of iterations of the Verlet Algorithm.
